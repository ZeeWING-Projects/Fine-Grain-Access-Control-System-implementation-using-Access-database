Task1:

I have applied Fine grained locking system and tested/executed each and every operation, as its name says, it is working fine. You may contact in case of any problem.



Task2:

For task 2 a few things must be known.

1. Before starting client, execute Server first. otherwise No data can be stored/fetched.
2.Before starting server, make sure you are connected to internet.
3.After you have started server, it is now on listening mode on fixed port i.e 5500.It can be changed as well.
4. Now you may start CLient and perform each request mentioned in Assignment.
5. Remember that database files and Java files must be in same directory, as I have provided.
6. I have used MS access for storing data, using SQL.


I have tested each option and it works perfect. In case any problem occurs feel free to reach once again.

Good day;
